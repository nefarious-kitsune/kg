<h1>Kingdom Guard Informer &mdash; Season {{SEASON NUMBER}}</h1>

<p>Information of some servers in the <em>first week</em>
of season {{SEASON NUMBER}}. Information here is <em>not</em>
up-to-date and may not reflect the reality of the servers.</p>

<h2>Why this page?</h2>

<p>During the Free Transfer period of each season, many players transfer
servers. Ideally, players would get permission from the alliances in
their destination before the jump. In reality, there is no publicly
available information on what server has what alliances, so players
would blindly make the jump and then regret it because they land in
servers that are dead or hostile.</p>

<p>KGI is a project to publish information on servers
over multiple seasons so that players have some usable reference
on where to transfer in future Free Transfer periods.</p>
