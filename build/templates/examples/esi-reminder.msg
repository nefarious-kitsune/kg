<Size=60><color=white><b><I>Evil Spirit Invasion</I></b></color></size>
<Color=black>In Evil Spirit invasion 20 waves of mobs will attack everyone in the alliance. waves 10 and 20 will hit the fortress so we will need to reinforce it. When the  waves send elite monsters  some people will likely need to be reinforced.
If you're able to withstand elites with only one troop in your castle then its best to send the rest to reinforce others, either pick some people and leave them there or send troops as mobs approach peoples castles. 
The more attacks you are involved with the more personal points you will get.
No one should rally during that event or teleport. 
If you teleport or get beaten twice it knocks you out of the fight but you can still earn points by reinforcing alliance members.</color>
