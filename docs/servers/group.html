<h1>Server Cluster</h1>

<p>There are three main groups of Kingdom Guard servers, which many players
refer to as S1, S2, and S3 servers.</p>

<p>The first cluster (S1) include all servers numbered 9001 to 9024. The entire
group was locked shortly after the second group was opened.</p>

<p>
  The second cluster (S2) include all servers numbered 401 to 1150
  as well as 2002.
  As of Season 27, the group has around 360 active servers
  (see <a href="./S27/server-status">Server Status</a>).
</p>

<p>
  The third cluster (S3) included all servers numbered 1151 or above.
  New servers in this cluster are opened on a daily basis
  (see <a href="./s3-history">S3 opening history</a>).
</p>

<h2>Server Differences</h2>

<p>S2 and S3 servers have different configurations. Because of this,
transfer between the two groups is currently impossible.</p>

        For example, as of 2024-01-05, the highest tier of
        Dragon Armor is T8 (Gilded), and players can
        obtain T5 (Legendary) for free through event.

        Many high-tier game items are still locked, and P2P
        players need to pay premium prices for middle-tier
        items such as T4 (Immortal) Dragon Armors.
