<h1>Server Groups</h1>

<p>There are three main groups of Kingdom Guard servers, which many players
refer to as S1, S2, and S3 servers.</p>

<p>The first group (S1) of servers are numbered 9001 to 9024. The entire
group was locked shortly after the second group was opened.</p>

<p>The second group (S2) of servers are numbered 401 to 1150. As of
Season 27, the group has around 360 active servers
(see <a href="./S27/server-status">S27 Server Status</a>).</p>

<p>The third group (S3) of servers are servers numbered 1120 or above.</p>

<h2>Server Differences</h2>

<p>S2 and S3 servers have different configurations. Because of this,
transfer between the two groups is currently impossible.</p>
