<h1>New Player Guide</h1>

<p>Information for new players.</p>

<div class="info-box">
Note: I have 2-year experience on <a href="../servers/group">S2</a>
but I have little experience with <a href="../servers/group">S3</a>.
I recently started a new account on S1742 so that
I could write a proper guide for new players.
Information here may be incomplete or even incorrect,
but I'll do my best to guide new players.
</div>

<h2>What is this game about?</h2>

<p>
  There is no <q>snake shooting</q>
  (or whatever was in the baiting commercial that you saw).
  While <a href="../guides/passing-levels">tower defense</a> is an
  important part, Kingdom Guard is mainly a
  <strong>war game</strong> where players
  join force in <a href="../alliance/">alliances</a>
  and fight in various <a href="../war/">wars</a>.
</p>

<h2>What to expect?</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../servers/phases/1/the-fog">The Fog</a>
  will gradually lift and allow your alliance to expand in other
  <a href="../guides/territory-building">territory</a>. When the entire
  map is cleared, alliances will fight for the throne in the
  Scorched Land at the center of the map. See
  <a href="../servers/phases/1/timeline">general timeline</a>.
</p>

<h2>What should I do?</h2>

<p>Things that all new players should do.</p>

<ul class="butterfly">
  <li>
    <p>
      Join an active alliance as soon as possible.
      <strong class="very-strong">Do not</strong> create your own alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the server first begins, the system automatically creates several
      empty alliances with their own Central Fortresses.

      These alliances will have names like <q>UN13</q> or <q>BR1</q>.

      The member who grows the fastest in power can become the leader (R5).
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, <strong>do not create your own alliance</strong>. You need
      20 members to start building a Central Fortress, and it's very
      unlikely you'll get that many. If your region has no active alliance,
      it's best to patiently wait for the fog to lift and move to a more
      active region instead.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do <a href="../alliance/tech">Alliance Tech</a> Donation as
    much as possible</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try to complete chapter 1-19 of the
    <a href="../dragon/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> as quickly as possible
    so you can unlock Dragon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try to complete five (5) quest levels of
    <a href="../jennifers-station/">Jennifer's Station</a> quickly
    so you can complete three (3) Gallery Puzzles (required for
    Dragon Quest).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="../guides/passing-levels">Pass levels</a> and
    upgrade your castle as quickly as you can. You need to reach
    Castle <strong>Lv. 159</strong> to unlock Academy and
    do the Academy Research to increase your March Queue from 2 to 3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Get your free 
      <a href="../guides/new-server/skin">Mini Titan avatar frame</a>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Join the
    <a href="https://discord.gg/7dcSzXnned">official Discord server</a>
    and meet other players. You can ask veteran players for tips.
