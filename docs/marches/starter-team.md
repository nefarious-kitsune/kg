# Building an Effective Starter Team

*Work in progress*

You may have seen screenshots of Hero Marches from people who either
have played the game for a long time or have spent a lot of money. You might
wonder, what can I do to build such a wonderful team?

Well, no worry. Building is not a *linear*, straight line - you don't start
with fifteen (15) heroes at one-star and end with the same fifteen (15) heroes
at five-star. As the game progresses, your needs will change and you have to
make adjustments accordingly. In fact,
__you can build an effective team with just C-tier and D-tier heroes__.

If you are F2P (free-2-play) or a light spender, here are some tips to build
your first team:

## Using Kris

At the very beginning, you may have gotten "your troops is too far" error
when you try to join rallies even if you are close to everyone else.
That's because you don't yet have any March Speed buff and your troops are
just too slow.

If you are F2P, Kris is your only option. Try to promote her to 1-star
to unlock her bonus **March Speed** skill as soon as you can. Use Kris
to join rallies and use your other slower heroes to do rallies.

Also, if you need to help build Obelisks, use Kris so you can save time.

## Locking Ophelia

When you level up a hero, you consume cards of other heroes. To make sure
you only use heroes of S and N rarity, all SR and SSR are locked by default...
well, all *except* Ophelia. This can lead players to accidentally consume
Ophelia cards when they shouldn't. To lock Ophelia:

- Go to the Heroes page and remove Ophelia from your Marches
- Tap the __Hero List__ icon on right, then tap the __Lock__ icon
- Tap __Ophelia__ icon to lock her

## Using Claudia

If you are a light spender, purchase the __Claudia Special__ and get
promote her to 1-star on the third day. Use her as the lead hero in
one of your March. Claudia has 20% bonus **Offline Gold** skill.
Combined with the +50% Vault purchase, you can get **70% offline gold**
with just $6

## Using Harold
