# Building an Effective Starter Team

*Work in progress*

## TL;DR

Don't like reading? Head straight to my examples of
[F2P builds](./examples/f2p-week-1) and
[casual-spender builds](./examples/casual-week-1).

You may have seen pictures of Hero Marches from people who either
have played the game for a long time or have spent a lot of money. You might
wonder, "what can I do to build something similar?"

No worry. Building is not a *linear*, straight line - you don't start
with 15 heroes at 1-star and end with the same 15 heroes at 5-star.
Before you get to the end-game, focus on building a team that help you grow.
In fact, you can build an effective team with just C-tier and D-tier heroes.

If you are F2P (free-2-play) or a light spender, here are some tips to build
your first team:

## Using Kris

In the very beginning, you may get "your troops is too far" error
when you try to join rallies. Your troops are not too far; they
are just *too slow*.

If you are F2P, Kris is your only option. Try to promote her to 1-star
to unlock her bonus **March Speed** skill as soon as you can. Use Kris
to join rallies and use your other slower heroes to do rallies.

Also, if you need to help build Obelisks, use Kris so you can save time.

## Locking Ophelia

When you level up a hero, you consume N and R hero cards.
By default, all SR and SSR hero cards are locked...
well, all *except* Ophelia. This can lead people to accidentally consume
Ophelia cards. To prevent this:

- Go to the Heroes page and remove Ophelia from your Marches
- Tap the __Hero List__ icon on right, then tap the __Lock__ icon
- Tap __Ophelia__ icon to lock her

## Using Claudia

If you can, purchase the $0.99 __Claudia Special__ to get her to
1-star on the third day. Use her as the lead hero in
one of your March. Claudia has 20% bonus **Offline Gold** skill.
Combined with the +50% Vault purchase, you can get **70% offline gold**
bonus with just 6 dollars.

Note that, in the long run, Claudia isn't a very useful hero. So, after
getting her to 1-star, I would recommend that you use resources on other
heroes first.

## Using Harold
