<h1>Cross-Server Invasion</h1>

<p>
  Cross-Server Invasion is a recurring event that's unlocked after a server
  enters the <a href="../../servers/timeline">SvS Phase</a>.
</p>

<h2>General Rules</h2>

<ul class="butterfly">
  <li>
    It's a one-day event that occurs on Sunday once every two weeks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Three (3) servers are matched up against each other in SvS.
  </li>
  <li>
    If an alliance holds a throne for 8 hours continuously, the alliance
    wins the throne, and the throne/towers of the server can no longer be
    attacked.
  </li>
  <li>
    If no alliance is able to hold throne for 8 hours continuously, then the
    alliance that holds the throne for the longest time wins the throne.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Attack or Defend?</h2>

<p>
  A server can choose to either
  (1) defend the throne at home,
  (2) attack the throne of another server,
  or (3) both.
</p>

<h2>Winning Home Throne</h2>

<p>Servers generally prioritize defending their home thrones.</p>

<ul class="butterfly">
  <li>If an alliance successfully wins the home throne, the R5
  of the alliance can appoint a player as the King/Queen of
  the server.</li>

  <li>The King (Queen) can distribute gift to other players.</li>

  <li>The King (Queen) can appoint other players as officials, and
  players who became officials will have certain buffs.</li>

  <li>The King (Queen) is able to search the location of another
  player and shackle the player (preventing the player from raising
  a shield or teleport). The skills enable the King (Queen) enforce
  server rules by punishing rule breakers.
</li>
</ul>
