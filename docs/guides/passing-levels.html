<h1>Passing Levels</h1>

<p>Some tips on passing tower defense levels.</p>

<ul class="butterfly">

<li>
  When you go to bed, load the game and keep your phone
  plugged in to the charger. The game will probably crash
  at some point, but when you wake up you should have
  passed a few dozen levels.
</li>

<li>
  Put your Ice Wizard at the first tower. The wizard can
  slow down invading monsters and make them easier to kill.
</li>


<li>
  If you are stuck, keep training new units and merge them
  until all units are at max level.
</li>

<li>
  If you still cannot pass levels, upgrade your units at
  the barrack.
  Do not exhaust your unit upgrade resources because you
  might need them in events.
</li>

<li>
  If you still cannot pass levels, upgrade your heroes.
</li>

<li>
  Do not switch your lead heroes to tower-defense heroes
  (e.g. Arwyn or Ophelia).
</li>

</ul>
