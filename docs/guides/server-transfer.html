<p>A mysterious portal has just opened. But will it be <em>Gate to Hell</em> or
<em>Gate to Heaven</em>? Follow these tips before you enter the portal.</p>

<ul class="butterfly">
<!--
<li>Players have reported that the **Bloodline event resets after transfer**.
If you transfer on Monday or Tuesday, you should still have time to complete the event.</li>
-->
<li>Know where you are going. If you don't know anyone there, make an
alter ego and scout the server first.</li>

<li>Before you move, check the server again. Remember, you are not the only
player moving. A rouge player or alliance might have landed in your
preferred destination and disrupted server peace with Mithril attack and
gold plundering.</li>

<li>Refresh alliance quests with gems until they are all SSR (gold). Try not
to claim any quest rewards before you move. The quests will not reset and you
may be splitting your alliance points among two alliances.</li>

<li>Spend all your lava cave points. You won't be able to do lava cave for
one week after you transfer. I don’t know if you will get ranking rewards,
but spend the points just in case.</li>

<li>Discount Store progress will reset, and you won't have time to unlock
the store again. Buy any item that you need to buy from the store. If
you haven't completed all levels, try to complete the levels before you
move.</li>

<li>Wishing Crystal Ball resets after you move. Do your free spin before you
move, and do it again after you move.</li>

<li>Mightiest Kingdom reset after you move. Do a little upgrades and claim
the daily reward before you move. Do it again after you move.</li>

<li><strong class="very-strong">claim alliance gold</strong> before you move.</li>

<li>Mithril reset after transfer. Send troops in Mithril mines as soon as you land.</li>
</ul>
