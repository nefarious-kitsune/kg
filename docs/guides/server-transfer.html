<h1>Free Server Transfer</h1>

<p>During the Free Transfer period, a mysterious portal will open.
The portal could either be a <em>Gate to Hell</em> or
a <em>Gate to Heaven</em>. But what will it be actually?
Follow these tips before you enter the portal.</p>

<h2>Look Before You Jump</h2>

<p>Because if you don't, you could end up in a very unpleasant place.</p>

<p>Different servers react to new players differently. Most active
servers do not want <em>uninvited</em> guests but will
<em>passively</em> accept them. Sometimes, the main
alliances have sister alliances that will accept new arrivals as long
as they follow server rules.</p> 

<p>However, some servers are <em>hostile</em> to uninvited guests
and will attack new players in order to get them to transfer on
the next Free Transfer period.</p>

<h2>Scout First</h2>

<p>Before Free Transfer opens, you should scout potential destination.
Even if you already <em>have invitation</em> to a server, you should
still scout first to see if the place is really as advertised.</p>

<p>Make a new character on your destination and monitor the activities
there. Don't just read the Kingdom Chat and look at the power leader chart.
Keep your scouting character somewhat active (make rallies, mine gold,
and do normal Mithril). That way, you can know if there are rouge players
there.</p>

<p>If possible, make your scouting character one season early. your
scouting character should be in an alliance, but it can only join
an alliance before Burning Expedition begins.</p>

<h2>Getting Permission</h2>

<blockquote class="pull-quote">
It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission
</blockquote>

<p>Leaders in many alliance will say that you should ask for permission before
you transfer. But in reality, most alliances do not want their information
made public. So firstly you probably don't even know whom you should ask,
and secondly, even if you do, the answer is probably a NO.</p>

<p>As the saying goes, it is <q>easier to ask for forgiveness than
permission</q>. If you scouted a server and believe it is a good fit for you,
it is probably easier if you transfer first and then apply in game.</p>

<h2>Scout Again</h2>

<p>Before you commit to the actual transfer, check the place again.
Remember, you are not the only player moving. A rouge player might have landed
in your preferred destination and disrupted server peace. Even worse,
another alliance might have landed and started a territorial war against
the locals.</p>

<h2>Have a Backup Plan</h2>

<p>Make sure there is another alliance you can go to if you cannot join
your preferred alliance.</p>

<!--
<ul class="butterfly">
<li>Know where you are going. If you don't know anyone there, make an
alter ego and scout the server first.</li>

<li>Before you move, check the server again. Remember, you are not the only
player moving. A rouge player or alliance might have landed in your
preferred destination and disrupted server peace with Mithril attack and
gold plundering.</li>

<li>Refresh alliance quests with gems until they are all SSR (gold). Try not
to claim any quest rewards before you move. The quests will not reset and you
may be splitting your alliance points among two alliances.</li>

<li>Spend all your lava cave points. You won't be able to do lava cave for
one week after you transfer. You won't get ranking rewards, but spend the
points just in case.</li>

<li>Discount Store progress will reset, and you won't have time to unlock
the store again. Buy any item that you need to buy from the store. If
you haven't completed all levels, try to complete the levels before you
move.</li>

<li>Wishing Crystal Ball resets after you move. Do your free spin before you
move, and do it again after you move.</li>

<li>Mightiest Kingdom reset after you move. Do a little upgrades and claim
the daily reward before you move. Do it again after you move.</li>

<li><strong class="very-strong">claim alliance gold</strong> before you move.</li>

<li>Mithril reset after transfer. Send troops in Mithril mines as soon as you land.</li>
</ul>
