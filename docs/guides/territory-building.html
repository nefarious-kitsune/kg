<p>Some tips on territory building for new R4/R5s.</p>

<ul class="butterfly">

<li>Do not build Central Fortress right next to the
  Scorched Land. Because Titans cannot spawn in the
  Scorched Land, Titans will spawn further away from
  your Central Fortress and your troops will take longer
  time to reach them.
  <br>(<a href="../images/territory_1.png">See example</a>)
</li>

<li>
  Do not build Central Fortress or Expedition Fortress
  next a Dragon Nest owned by someone else.
  It’s usually viewed as declaration of war.
</li>

<li>
  Avoid touching another alliance's territory unless if you
  are trying to claim altars or reach the other side. Unnecessary
  touching is usually viewed as declaration of war.
</li>

<li>
  It is possible to <q>jump</q> across another alliance's territory.
  <br>(<a href="../images/territory_2.png">See example</a>)
</li>

<li>
  Be courteous and do not take any owned Dragon Nest without asking.
  Let R5 of the owner alliance know so they can recall troops still
  mining in the nest.
</li>

<li>
  Central Fortress and Expedition Fortress do not need to be
  connected to each other. It is best to keep them separate
  so you can claim more altars.
  <br>(<a href="../images/territory_3.png">See example</a>)
</li>

<li>
  Build in zig-zag fashion. You can reach more altars
  that way.
  <br>(<a href="../images/territory_4.png">See example</a>)
</li>

<li>
  If you have many new players, make sure you have a level 1 and a
  level 2 Dragon Nest. Your player need to occupy them to complete
  Alliance Achievements.
</li>

<li>
  Get as many Gold altars as you can. If you have many of them, your
  players can earn >50M gold daily without doing anything.
</li>

<li>
  Do not waste an obelisk to claim a Stone altar. Stone altars are
  very abundant and you will get many without trying.
</li>

<li>
  Build build build. Good territory takes a lot of patience.
  Mistakes will be made, and rebuilding is inevitable.
</li>
</ul>
