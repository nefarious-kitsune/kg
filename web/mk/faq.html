  <h1>Mightiest Kingdom Upgrade Planner FAQ</h1>

  <h2>Why making this tool?</h2>
  <p>
    Many players save resources for weeks <em>or even months</em> in order
    to win the top rewards in the Mightiest Kingdom /
    Ultimate Power event.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, even with a lot of resources saved, it is hard for players
    to know if they would have enough points. If they spend the resources
    too soon and did not win, the experience would be very painful.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <a href="planner.html">planner tool</a> helps players estimate
    how much points they can get from the event and therefore make
    more informed decisions.
  </p>

  <h2>How accurate are the calculated results?</h2>
  <p>
    I do not have all the data on the upgrade costs of
    Witch's Lab and Blacksmith. Nevertheless, I believe
    the calculated result should be fairly close to
    the actual result.
